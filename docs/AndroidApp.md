# Phimpme android app

  Photo app.

## Development Setup

Before you begin, you should already have the Android Studio SDK downloaded and set up correctly. You can find a guide on how to do this here: [Setting up Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)

### Setting up the Android Project

1. Download the *phimpme-android* project source. You can do this either by forking and cloning the repository (recommended if you plan on pushing changes) or by downloading it as a ZIP file and extracting it.

2. Open Android Studio, you will see a **Welcome to Android** window. Under Quick Start, select *Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)*

3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the phimpme-android project, select the root folder of the project (the folder named "phimpme-android"), and hit OK. Android Studio should now begin building the project with Gradle.

4. Once this process is complete and Android Studio opens, check the Console for any build errors.

    - *Note:* If you recieve a Gradle sync error titled, "failed to find ...", you should click on the link below the error message (if avaliable) that says *Install missing platform(s) and sync project* and allow Android studio to fetch you what is missing.

5. Once all build errors have been resolved, you should be all set to build the app and test it.

6. To Build the app, go to *Build>Make Project* (or alternatively press the Make Project icon in the toolbar).

7. If the app was built succesfully, you can test it by running it on either a real device or an emulated one by going to *Run>Run 'app'* or presing the Run icon in the toolbar.
